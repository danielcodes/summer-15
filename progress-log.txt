SUMMER INTERSHIP PROJECT
prototype is stable after last commit on june 17th

--means issues

GOAL: A small web application that displays images and data regarding a specific room on a floor plan

PROGRESS LOG
06/22/15
-display floor plan img as is, zoom in and out with ctrl + and -
-testing the onclick function for the symbol, which should lock the window and display a picture and some data
-keep it to one image per room to reduce complexity

06/23/15
-figure out hover function and make it display html
-organize the html displayed into an image (no more panoramas) and the tabular data
-need to maintain picture size consistent, in order to crop out the non-used border
-finish and add it onto hover
-END, finished the html block that must display when hovering
-TMR, need to implement hover

06/24/15
-still working on hover
-get images, crop through photoshop to maintain high resolution
--From jsfiddle to the actual pages, modifications were made on the list as things were not displaying properly
-currently using hover to toggle on the display function
--need to add timer to hover
--rewrite hover display script so that it is able to pull data off server
--problem where the display can extend the page, need to tell it to display based on the current size of the screen
END, got the hover feature to work, need to further implement hoverIntent
TMR, set a default size for the svg images

06/25/15
-set sizes for svg images for display, nac building?
--send email to set up meeting to further discuss details of the project
-finish ajax tutorials on youtube
-look into light box from book

---WEEKEND

06/29/15
-need to solidify planning stage, from UI to database structure
-finish learning ajax tutorial
-if hover can stay within page boundaries, it would be an ok solution
--two issues, timer on hover and respecting page boundaries
450 in the ajax tutorial
-learned to move things up a directory (mv * .[^.]* ..)

06/30/15
-new aim for the project: create a web tool, not the end product
-this is a new line
--git was not cloning, had to reload vagrant box
-can't create my own api yet, can either be formatting or missing the .json
-finish installing nodejs, after the curl command
-attemt to get data from own-setup api

07/01/15
-install nodejs
-need to move picture urls from github to the VM's server - done
**CALL LENOVO TO DO A HARD RESET ON THE BATTERY**
-the sandbox folder on the server, when openede up, renders the html file
--no need to keep sand repo on VM, use sync folder to update images
--send email regarding changeds, building a tool not end product
--display two dots creates an issue, as the jquery selector targets all the containers, need to it targed only at symbol i'm looking it, child of blue
--made some additions to the ajax tutorial, cached added elements, define new params in the object on the POST function, add to template for renderin

07/02/15
-cloned a separate sandbox repo on root, the one finished with all the tutorials
--FE, read over lightbox chapter and try to implement it. The main problem is to maintain static content (table data) and to have the ability to change through the pictures
--BE, need to create a form that creates an html symbol (template) on the page
--need to set up own api on the VM, to test the adding and retrieving of data
**getting closer to fixing the batter issue**, must uninstall the lenovo driver
-save commits locally, but DO NOT PUSH it to github repo
-got a api to work with, api/daniel/friends
END
need to finish the form, add post request first and place element into the page
FE, need for a new display, lightbox with slider with a fixed div for data
BE, take inputted data from the form and shape it into an html element

ISSUES
-make the form line up
-provide link to image -> need a solution for several pictures


Tesing templating on sandbox clone
-hardcode, before creating a template
-can create simple app from scratch, without edit

--

07/05/15
-still working on the form that creates html, specifically the post request
-correctly spitting information into the page, now format it
-need to create symbol, also need to make it accessible on my main pc
-hover function not working on added elements

--

07/06/15
-create event listener for added elements, new div activate hover
-click to display, done. click outisde to hide, done
-now need to make the symbol draggable
--copy the room-form folder into sandbox repo and push it up, ASAP
-the drag function should have a switch
-symbol needs 2 event listeners, display and drag, that means that 2 modes of viewership are needed
-disable click and apply drag, separate tasks 
-room form can also be formatted accordingly
**CALL ABOUT THE BATTERY PROBLEM ASAP**
-gotta read jquery ui documentation
--data box list can be compressed to give the picture more space

07/07/15
-edit mode, on click, highlight (activate a black border)
-can be done by adding a class or an id, targeted
-creating a target symbol works, future: only select on symbol at a time
-next, work on draggable
--also, just as images are added, a background image needs to be added as well for the plan when creating the database, create floor-4/2 folders, floorplan and rooms. Format can be decided later
-GOAL: before demo, must have draggabel symbols and be able to create multiple instances of them
--problem installing node modules on vagrant box
TEMP fix
installing bower through npm was fixed by adding -sudo-
cloned through https rather than git, to install packages
-start working on a repo from the vm, to have access to tools
-able to drag symbol, now need to change position after the element has been dragged
-bug with target drag

07/08/15
-spend a good chunk of time on nonsense
-need to make it so that only the target is draggable
-draw page on paper, the functionality of 2 pages, view and edit
-symbol now only drags when highlighted
-erase nodes on page, need this asap, will be done with a droppable trash
-create radio buttons to toggle between modes
--demistify, the delete function from the tutorial, this must be put together along with the droppable trash
-problem where both modes get activated at the same time
--solution: using a submit button that refreshes the page so that only one of the events fire, either view or edit

07/09/15
-colored boxes that displayy status, and since there are only two states, the user can toggle between them. Set view by default 
--fix npm symlink issue, as packages can't be installed
-two goals for the weekend, isolate the two different code firing (edit and view)
and also create the droppable trash (http delete request)
---after all that's finished, need to add extra parameters to the object, to store coordinates on drag. Post drag, the server should dish desired coordinates

--

07/11/15
-fixed express issue by adding --no-bin-links, sigh get a mac

-adminLTE, for admin UI
-can replace the target functionality with focus function
-remove button altogether, inject class to provide functionality

--

07/13/15
-still working on isolating the functionality of view and edit
--solution, when one event is activated, disable the other
-call the lenovo people, this problem HAS to be fixed

07/14/15
-explain that the project is data driven, from DB tables to JSON strings. This makes collection of data essential, and rending it all on the web is a simple GET request
-2 items that need work, are the dropppable trash and saving the state of a dragged object
-do a GET request and put the data set in a variable, then it becomes a problem of scope and still not sure as to how the success function works

07/15/15
-testing slotting the symbol based on coordinates of left and top - nope
-inserting left and top as input fields works, same problem. need to rewrite the top and left fields with a put request
-recreate the object from scratch, then send it back

07/20/15
-will work on adding the floor plan through a link

07/21/15
-button on click, add css to div with outer div
-bug where the dots ovelap container and dots are not visible over form
-USE POSTMAN
-solve issue of rendering 

07/22/15
-working on new front page
-need to prep for discussion topics tomorrow

07/23/15
-how can that one single page be replicated and added every building floor has it's own page
-floor images will be stored in a database and javascript page needs to be templated

--

07/27/15
-don't know how to scale the product, creating javascript on the fly and having all the



************* SEPARATE SECTION - VAGRANT **********************************

LEARNING TO USE VAGRANT

-provisions are written in the vagrant file, in this case install apache, so it is telling it to install new software
-after reloading, a server was spun up but it needs more in order to be seen on the web

networking options
-port forwarding, ports on the guest to share on host 


ISSUES
-Machine somehow lost sync with vagrant, remade VM
-the issue was solved through provision, what the heck is that?
